# docker-homeautomation

It is part of a [set of repositories](https://github.com/search?q=user%3Admartingarcia+docker) that contain dockerised environments for small applications.

In this case, it contains a self-efficient minimal *minecraft server* setup, and yes, you know what it is.

## How to use it

```
docker-compose up -d
```

And connect into `http://localhost:25565`.

After that, start gathering reosurces, creating and building your own house, and so on, and so on... typical Minecraft workflow

## Traefik integration`

Still doing that.
